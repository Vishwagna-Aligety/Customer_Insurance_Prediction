# Customer Insurance Purchase Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase insurance based on age and estimated salary. Multiple machine learning models were tested, and *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* emerged as the most effective.

##  Features
- Implements Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Compares performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Provides predictions for given scenarios
- Includes graphical analysis for purchase behavior
